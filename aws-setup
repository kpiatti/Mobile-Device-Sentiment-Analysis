aws-setup

after creating an account you will need to do the following:
- install the aws command line interface (CLI)--version 2
- from aws webpage: set up users and specify their permissions
	- after user set up you will get an access key id and secret access key....downloadable as csv file
- from aws command line interface: run 'aws configure'
	- for sentiment analysis project you'll need:
		- Access Key (you downloaded this while setting up your account)
		- Secret Access Key (you downloaded this while setting up your account)
		- Default Region Name: us-east-1
		- Default Output Format: json

to interact with files stored on aws s3, use cyberduck (not sure this is strictly required)
